#Cascading Modification/Issue Handling Rules: 

Consider this, for solving major bugs or errors that require critical identification and crucial thinking with updation of data in nested segments carefully. 

MANDATORY PROCESS:
1. BEFORE making any changes: Analyze the ENTIRE codebase to find ALL references to this code
2. Create a comprehensive list of affected files/functions
3. Plan all necessary updates to maintain consistency
4. Implement the primary change AND all dependent updates
5. Verify no broken references remain

DELIVERABLES:
- Impact analysis report
- List of all modified files with reasons
- Complete implementation of primary change + all updates
- Verification that no references are broken
