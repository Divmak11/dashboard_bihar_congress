# Core Rules

 
- Update CodeMap (.windsurf/codeMap.md) with every file change or refactoring to keep it updated. 
- Always make sure the modifications doesn't break the exisiting functionalities implemented before that. 
  
- Follow the project's coding standards and best practices (e.g., TypeScript, React, functional components, named exports).
- Ask for clarification if any requirement or instruction is ambiguous.
- Only touch files where implementation is needed and nothing outside the scope.
