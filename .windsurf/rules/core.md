# Core Rules

- For any task Always first refer to (.windsurf/codeMap.md) to get around which files to touch. As it works as a lookBook which is updated regularly.

- Update CodeMap (.windsurf/codeMap.md) with every file change or refactoring to keep it updated. 

- Always make sure the modifications doesn't break the exisiting functionalities implemented before that unless required. 
  
- Follow the project's coding standards and best practices (e.g., TypeScript, React, functional components, named exports).

- Ask for clarification if any requirement or instruction is ambiguous.

- Only touch files where implementation is needed and nothing outside the scope.

-  Always follow SOLID principles when planning for any implementation.

- Always keep Models, Scripts, Helpers, Core Business Logic and UI separately either during any implementation or any modifcation.
