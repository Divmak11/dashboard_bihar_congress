# Core Rules

- For every implementation, use occam's razon principle of suggesting the simplest approach.
- Always use the smallest diff approach for any implementation and avoid refactoring unrelated code. 
- Keep answers short, concise and upto the point.
- Never elaborate if not specifically asked.
- Only do the task which is asked or suggested and never extend.
- DOn't start any implementation until asked for or confirmed/
- Follow the project's coding standards and best practices (e.g., TypeScript, React, functional components, named exports).
- Ask for clarification if any requirement or instruction is ambiguous.
- Only touch files where implementation is needed and nothing outside the scope.
