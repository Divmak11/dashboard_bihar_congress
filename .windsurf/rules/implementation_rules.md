For when doing any kind of implementation or modification follow the below guidelines : 

Guidelines:

2. Analyse the code base thoroughly by referring (.windsurf/CodeMap.md) to check which files and code segements needs to be updated.
3. Identify Changes that needs to be done. 
4. Check for similar places that require updation with the change proposed.
5. Consider updating the code segments you found, that needs to be updated with the changes implemented.
6. Always use SOLID principles.

- Avoid refactoring unrelated code.
- Avoid modifying existing code when its outside the scope.
- Updating the (.windsurf/CodeMap.mp) after the changes
